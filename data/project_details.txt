              Developing a real-time landslide detection system using IoT,
              robotics, and AI to enhance disaster preparedness in Sri Lanka.
              The system monitors soil moisture, ground vibrations, and
              rainfall, sending instant mobile alerts to residents and
              authorities when risk thresholds are reached. Using AI and machine
              learning to improve predictions, the project aligns with NBRO
              standards to ensure effective deployment. Aims to provide a
              scalable, cost-effective solution to reduce landslide risks.

              Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI analyzing 51,000+ sales
              records across 25 attributes, focusing on sales trends, regional
              performance, product demand, and shipping efficiency. Managed data
              cleaning, transformation, and modeling to ensure accuracy, and
              used clear visual storytelling to present insights for better
              decision-making. This project strengthened my practical BI
              reporting and data analysis skills while delivering accessible,
              actionable business insights.

              Conducted a statistical study exploring whether undergraduates are
              losing independent thinking skills due to frequent AI use. Using
              surveys and applying descriptive, correlation, and regression
              analysis on responses from 30 NIBM undergraduates, we examined the
              relationship between AI usage, productivity, and academic
              confidence. Findings showed AI tools are widely used for coding
              and research, with a moderate trend suggesting frequent AI users
              may feel slightly less confident working independently,
              highlighting the need to balance AI support with critical thinking
              development in education.
